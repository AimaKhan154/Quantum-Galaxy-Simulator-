🚀 Quantum Shaper — Interactive 3D Particle System

An advanced real-time 3D particle visualization system powered by gesture recognition.
Quantum Shaper allows users to manipulate thousands of particles in 3D space using hand movements detected through a webcam.

This project combines computer graphics, real-time rendering, and computer vision to create an immersive interactive experience.

📌 Overview

Quantum Shaper renders a dynamic particle system that morphs into multiple mathematically generated shapes. Users control the system using intuitive hand gestures such as movement, pinch, and hand expansion.

The application integrates GPU-accelerated rendering with real-time gesture detection to deliver smooth and responsive interaction.

✨ Features

🎇 Real-time 3D particle rendering (6000+ particles)

🖐️ Hand gesture recognition via webcam

🔄 Smooth morphing between multiple complex shapes

🌌 Procedural starfield background

🎨 Dynamic color transitions

⚡ GPU-accelerated rendering using WebGL

🧠 Organic “breathing” particle animation

📱 Responsive full-screen canvas

🧬 Available Particle Shapes

Nebula Sphere

Spiral Galaxy

Double Helix (DNA)
